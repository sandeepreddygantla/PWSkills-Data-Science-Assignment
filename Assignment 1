Q1. Who developed Python programming Language?
ANS. Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Q2. which type of programming does python support?
ANS. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:
      1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
      2. Structured Programming
      3. Functional Programming
      4. Aspect-Oriented Programming
      5. Procedural Programming.
      
      Python is often described as a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning that it can be used for multiple programming styles, 
      and it's up to the programmer to choose the best approach for the task at hand.

Q3. Is python case senstive when dealing with python identifiers?       
ANS. Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with Python identifiers, such as variable names, function names, and class names. 
     This means that a variable named "Hello" is different from a variable named "hello" or "HELLO". 

Q4. What is the correct extension of the python file?
ANS. The correct extension for a Python file is ".py". This is the standard file extension for Python scripts 
     and indicates to the operating system that the file should be executed as a Python script.
     
Q5. Is python code compiled or interpreted?
ANS. Python is an interpreted language. This means that the source code of a Python program is executed line by line, 
    rather than being compiled into machine code and executed directly by the computer's processor. 
    The Python interpreter reads the code, evaluates it, and produces the results, allowing the programmer to quickly see the results of their code without having to compile it first.
    
Q6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language
ANS. In Python, a few blocks of code used to define structures are:

    1. Functions: defined using the "def" keyword, functions are used to encapsulate code and can be called multiple times.

    2. Classes: defined using the "class" keyword, classes are used to define objects and encapsulate data and behavior.

    3. Loops: defined using "for" and "while" keywords, loops are used to repeat blocks of code multiple times.

    4. Conditionals: defined using "if" and "elif" keywords, conditionals are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

    5. Context Managers: defined using the "with" keyword, context managers are used to manage resources such as files or network connections.
