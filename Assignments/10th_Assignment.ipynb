    "'a' (Append Only): This mode is used when you want to add new data to a file. If the file already exists, the data is appended to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is used to create a new file. If the file already exists, the operation fails and an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a binary file. In this mode, the file is treated as a sequence of bytes.\n",

    "It is important to close a file after it has been used to release system resources and prevent data corruption. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources for it, such as memory and file handles. If a file remains open for an extended period of time, these resources can be depleted, leading to performance problems and potential data corruption. Additionally, if a file is not properly closed, any changes made to the file may not be saved. Therefore, it is a good practice to close a file after it has been used, to ensure that system resources are released and changes are saved."
